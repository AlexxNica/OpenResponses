// HACK(mdr): Attach an inline comment to each media query to make it unique.
//
// Aphrodite accepts an object that maps keys (like media queries) to values
// (like the set of rules that we should apply under that media query). But the
// keys of a JS object are, by definition, unique. So, if we compute two media
// queries dynamically, and they happen to evaluate to the same string, they'll
// conflict. JS resolves key conflicts in object literals by discarding all but
// the last key-value pair, so some rules are thrown out before Aphrodite even
// gets the chance to see them - which means that those rules will never be
// applied! D: (This happened in the content library's FloatingSidebar.)
//
// We _could_ solve this problem by building a higher-level API to help us
// merge those two rule sets before passing them to Aphrodite. That'd be pretty
// sweet, but also nontrivial, so we're not going to do that right now.
//
// Instead, we just attach a unique comment string to each of the media queries
// in this file. That way, if another media query has the same constraints as
// one of these queries, their strings won't be identical, and they therefore
// won't conflict.
//
// It's legal to put inline comments just about anywhere in CSS, so just about
// any CSS parser should be satisfied - but we tested in all major supported
// browsers, just to be sure :)
